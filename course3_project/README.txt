Title: Modern Robotics Course 3 (Robot Dynamics) Project
Created by: Haoxiang Li

Environment: Matlab, V-REP
Description: Simulate the UR5 Robot motion using V-REP with joint vectors calculated
by Forward Dynamics using Matlab.

Content List:
1. code/task1.m: code for task1 by given constants, start with zero position
2. code/task2.m: code for task2 by given constants, start with joint 2 at -1 radian
                 and other joint at 0
3. simulation1.csv: calculation results by code/task1.m
4. Simulation2.csv: calculation results by code/task2.m
5. record_task1.mp4: video record from V-REP with simulation1.csv
6. record_task2.mp4: video record from V-REP with simulation2.csv
