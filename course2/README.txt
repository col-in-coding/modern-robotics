Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control
Course 2 Project
Environment: Matlab, V-Rep

Description:
Use iterative Newton-Raphson to calculate the Inverse kinematics of the UR5 robot


Content List:
1) IKinBodyIterates.m: rewrite the function "IKinBody" from MR lib
2) main.m: main contents to run, including all the configurations and initials
3) screenshot & recording: V-rep simulation to confirm the result
4) iterates.csv: joint vectors for each iteration, generated by IKinBodyIterates
5) log.txt: log file for main.m running outputs from Matlab console
